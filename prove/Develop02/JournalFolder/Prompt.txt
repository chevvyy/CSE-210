What’s one moment from today (or this week) where I felt genuinely proud of myself?
If the version of me from five years ago could see my life right now, what would surprise them the most?
What’s something I’ve been quietly carrying (a worry, a regret, a hope, a grudge) that I haven’t really let myself name out loud yet?
When do I feel most like the truest version of myself?
If fear wasn’t allowed to vote in my decisions for the next 6 months, what would I start, stop, or change right now?
